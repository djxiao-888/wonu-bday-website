            <h3>To make this website more meaningful...</h3>
            <p>I don't know how to start this message honestly ðŸ˜­ But one thing's for sure, every single one of you has
                a
                very special, distinct place in my heart. AJ, Athena, Cian, Tine, CM, Sam, Lia, Maia, Marrion, Nicole,
                Ven, Thea, thank you for being a part of me. Thank you for the joys you've shared with me and the gifts
                you've given me. I honestly can't ever repay you all that much for the things you've done to/done
                with/given me. My love language is quality time, so everytime I hang out with you guys (esp gala) already
                means so much to me. And my life would ever be miserable without you guys. As in, salamat talaga sa
                lahat-lahat. I LOVE YOU ALL ðŸ’—ðŸ’—</p>
