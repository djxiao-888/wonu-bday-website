            <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! Omg
                tanda mo na ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜” charot. Okay first of all, I want to thank you so much for being my
                bestest of the best friend, ka-partner, ka-duo, partner, etc. anything you can think of. Our bond is
                getting stronger and stronger day by day. I really did not expect it to become this strong after about 3
                years? i think yeah. Anyways, if we look back, notice that we've made so many memories together. It's
                really good to reminisce about those days. All those times I've spent with you are all well-kept and
                cherished, as promised. Also, kahit nakikita ko yung presence mo online makes my day okay na eh. Even
                these days na it's just you and me nalang chatting, in my perspective, i still manage to laugh and feel
                happy. You always save me from becoming miserable. I want you to know that. I really couldn't spend a
                day without talking to you. I really want to thank you for always being there for me, especially when I
                desperately need someone to talk to. You always make my days better. Thank you for the comfort, care,
                and love even though they're just given through words, given that we're in this kind of setup. Even
                though we're far apart physically, our bond will never weaken. I really value you the most. I can extend
                my thank you note to a thousand words literally but i think i should end it here. To sum up the thank
                you part, thank you!</p>

            <p>Every person has a dream, and ik you have a dream. I may not have a clear idea of what you dream for but
                as long as you work hard for it, you'll surely get it. No dream is worthless. Every dream of unique and
                special. If you want to join the culinary world, you should! I will support you no matter what. RUN FOR
                YOUR HEART! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! RUN FOR YOUR DREAM!</p>

            <p>You and I, we can fly. Let's just run for our lives! I really hope that more opportunities and
                adventures will come your way. I hope that this new chapter of your life will serve as a springboard for
                further success. I also wish you all of the best. Always remember that I'm here for you and I will stay
                by your side. Once again, happy happy birthday!! Love you!!</p>
